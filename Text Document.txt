BRIAN YU: All right, welcome, everyone, to Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. My name is Brian Yu. And in this course, we'll dive into the design and implementation of web applications. 

In lectures, we'll have an opportunity to discuss and explore many of the ideas and tools and languages that are central to modern web programming. And through hands-on projects, you'll have an opportunity to take those ideas and put them into practice, designing multiple web applications of your own, culminating in a final project of your own choosing. Throughout the term, we'll cover a number of topics in this world of web programming, beginning with HTML5 and CSS3, two of the languages that are central to the understanding of web pages. HTML is a language we'll use to describe the structure of a web page. And CSS is the language we'll use to describe the style of a web page, the colors and the fonts and the layouts and the spacing that make the web page look exactly the way we want it to look.
